ChangeLog for package koRpus

changes in version 0.12-1 (2019-04-03)
unreleased:
  - this release is under development
fixed:
  - query(): method was broken for tagged objects
  - textTransform(): method was broken
  - class kRp.txt.trans: renamed column "token.old" into "token.orig", which
    is what was actually used by textTransform(); also added a validity test
    for those column names to prevent confusion
  - readTagged(): adjusted default encoding
added:
  - query(): new method for objects of class data.frame, which is now used if
    query() is being called on koRpus class objects
  - query(): now also supports all numerical queries for tagged texts that
    were previously only available for frequency objects
  - filterByClass(): a new method for tagged text objects, replacing the
    kRp.filter.wclass() function, which is now deprecated
  - pasteText(): like filterByClass(), but replacing kRp.text.paste()
  - readTagged(): like filterByClass(), but replacing read.tagged()
  - readTagged(): new argument mtx_cols for new tagger="manual" setting, allowing
    to import data POS tagged with third party tools
  - diffText()/diffText()<-: new getter/setter methods for the "diff" slot of
    transformed text objects
  - originalText(): new method to revert text transformations and get the
    original text
  - kRp.POS.tags(): now includes universal POS tags by default
  - new unit tests for many methods, including query(), textTransform(),
    readTagged(), filterByClass(), pasteText(), diffText(), originalText(),
    jumbleWords(), and clozeDelete()
changed:
  - tokenize(): now a S4 method for objects of class character and connections
  - treetag(): now a S4 method for objects of class character and connections
  - class kRp.txt.trans: "diff" slot now also lists the transformations done
    to the tokens in a new list element called "transfmt"
  - language support: if you try using a preset but the langauge package
    wasn't loaded or even installed, a more elaborate error message is returned
    with hopefully useful hints to what to try next
  - jumbleWords(): now a S4 method, no longer a function; the resulting
    object is now also of class kRp.txt.trans if the input was a tagged text
    object, preserving the original tokens
  - clozeDelete(): now returns an object of class kRp.txt.trans, dropping the
    additional data frame in "desc"; this ist much more consistent with other
    text transformations in the packahe
  - cTest(): like clozeDelete() now returns an object of class kRp.txt.trans,
    dropping the additional data frame in "desc"
  - moved class union definition kRp.taggedText to its own file and updated
    the import calls on a number of files accordingly
  - textTransform(): moved the whole code segment that combines the
    transformed text into the returned object to a separate internal function so it can
    be re-used by other text transforming methods
  - cTest(): changed method signature from kRp.tagged to class union kRp.taggedText
  - summary(): changed method signature from kRp.tagged to class union kRp.taggedText
  - plot(): changed method signature from kRp.tagged to class union kRp.taggedText
  - lex.div(): removed the validation warning for MATTR, implementation has been
    validated by kevin cunningham and katarina haley
  - restructured source code files

changes in version 0.11-5 (2018-10-27)
changed:
  - set.kRp.env()/treetag(): now throws an error if you try to combine a
    language preset with TreeTagger's batch files as the tagger to use; some users
    seem to be confused about what to configure, and this error message
    hopefully helps them to understand why treetag() must fail in these cases
  - treetag(): newer versions of TreeTagger will no longer have "utf8" in
    their parameter and abbreviation files. since we never know what version of
    TreeTagger we're dealing with, treetag() will from now on look for files
    with "utf8" if specified in the language package, but not fail if none is
    found, but also try for a non-labelled file and replace the file name on the
    fly if one is found
  - grapheme clusters: in UTF-8, certain characters in some languages are
    shown as a single character, but technically are several characters combined.
    nchar() counts all combined parts individially, which in most use cases
    for this package is not what one expects. it now uses nchar(type="width")
    for a letter count that is much closer to user's expectations
fixed:
  - set.lang.support(): explicitly set the sorting method for factor levels
    to "radix" as the new default "auto" (R >= 3.5) produced unstable results
    with different setups; hence some of the test standards also had to be
    updated

changes in version 0.11-4 (2018-07-29)
fixed:
  - templates: incomplete package name in license header
  - read.BAWL(): updated download URL and added DOI
changed:
  - the startup check for available language packages was reduced to short
    hints to available.koRpus.lang() and install.koRpus.lang()
  - the startup message can now be suppressed by adding
    "noStartupMessage=TRUE" to the koRpus options in .Rprofile

changes in version 0.11-3 (2018-03-07)
fixed:
  - treetag()/tokenize(): fixed an issue with sentence numbering which was
    triggered if all sentences were of equal length
  - query(): method failed for columns which are now factors
changed:
  - treetag(): koRpus no longer fails with an error if unknown tags are
    found. there will be a warning, but you can continue to work with the object
  - depends on R >= 3.0.0 now
  - improved available.koRpus.lang() to make it more obvious how to install
    language support packages, and which
  - session settings done with set.kRp.env() or queried by get.kRp.env() are
    no longer stored in an internal environment but the global .Options; this
    also allows for setting defaults in an .Rprofile file using options()
  - in the docs, improved the link format for classes, omitting the "-class"
    suffix
  - set.lang.support(): the levels of tag, wclass, and desc are now
    automatically sorted; test standards had to be adjusted accordingly
added:
  - set.lang.support(): new argument "merge"; it is now possible to add or
    update single POS tag definitions
  - new class object contructors kRp_tagged(), kRp_TTR(), kRp_txt_freq(),
    kRp_txt_trans(), kRp_analysis(), kRp_corp_freq(), kRp_lang(), and
    kRp_readability() can be used instead of new("kRp.tagged", ...) etc.

changes in version 0.11-2 (2018-01-07)
attention:
  - this is a testing release introducing major changes in the way language
    support is handled (see other changes in this log). tl;dr: you must install
    additional koRpus.lang.** packages to fully restore the previous
    functionality, i.e., all supported languages. see ?install.koRpus.lang
fixed:
  - treetag(): with TT.tknz=FALSE, the last letter of a text was truncated
    due to a missing newline at the end of the tempfile (thanks to adam
    spannbauer for both reporting and fixing it)
  - treetag(): hopefully fixed a nasty encoding issue on windows, again
  - treetag(): fixed an issue that could be triggered by hard to tokenize
    texts exceeding a default limit of summary() for factors
  - treetag()/tokenize(): silenced warnings of readLines() for missing final
    EOL of input files
changed:
  - language support: while the sylly package is released on CRAN now, its
    separate language packages were not allowed to be published there as well. a
    special repository was therefore set up on gitub and added via the
    "Additional_repositories" field to the DESCRIPTION file. however, not having the
    sylly.XX packages on CRAN made it necessary to further modularize the
    package and complete remove all out-of-the-box language support (see removed
    section). all these support packages for language are now being resolved
    by installing from that repo instead of CRAN.
  - package loading: when koRpus is being loaded, it now checks for available
    (i.e. already installed) language packages. if none are found, it asks
    you to install one. i'm sorry for the unconvenience
  - vignette is now in RMarkdown/HTML format; the SWeave/PDF version was
    dropped
added:
  - tif_as_tokens_df(): new method to get TT.res in fully TIF compliant format
  - new functions available.koRpus.lang() and install.koRpus.lang() for more
    convenient handling of language support packages.
removed:
  - language support: koRpus previously supported some languages directly
    (de, en, es, fr, it, and ru). this support had to be removed and is now
    available as separate language packages via
    https://undocumeantit.github.io/repos/l10n

changes in version 0.11-1 (2017-06-20)
fixed:
  - kRp.lang: fixed the show() and summary() methods to omit country
    information which was dropped from the UDHR data a while ago
  - treetag(): windows users might run into problems because of differences
    between the file separators R uses internally when they are also used in
    shell() calls. this hasn't been an issue earlier, but is worked around now
    anyway. hope this doesn't cause new issues...
changed:
  - kRp.tagged: the TT.res data.frame of the object class has new columns
    "doc_id", "idx" (index), and "sntc" (sentence), with "doc_id" now being the
    first column before "token" to comply with the Text Interchange Formats
    proposed by rOpenSci
  - kRp.tagged: in TT.res, the columns "tag", "wclass" and "desc" are no
    longer character vectors but factors. this doesn't actually change the class
    definition, as TT.res just has to be a data.frame, but it reduces the
    object size especially for larger texts, and makes it much simpler to do
    analysis with these objects
  - tokenize()/treetag()/read.tagged(): these functions now add token index
    and sentence number to the resulting objects; document ID is added if
    provided
  - kRp.lang: depending on the information available in the UDHR data, the
    show() and summary() methods' output is now dynamically adjusted; summary()
    now also lists the columns "iso639-3" and "bcp47" by default
  - treetag(): debug output for tokenize() looks a little nicer
  - kRp.text.transform(): the old function is now deprecated and was replaced
    by a proper S4 method called textTransform(). the old one will work for
    the moment, but you'll get a warning
  - the tt slot in class kRp.TTR gained two new entries called "type.in.txt"
    and "type.in.result", which will contain a list of all types with the
    index where it is to be found in the original text or the lex.div() results
    respectively, if type.index=TRUE; the indices might differ because the
    result might be stripped of certain word classes
  - treetag()/tokenize(): internal workflow for adding word class and
    description of tags was modularized for more detailed control. you can now toggle
    whether you want the verbose description of each tag added directly to
    objects with the new argument "add.desc". it is set in the environment by
    set.kRp.env() and defaults to FALSE, making the objects about 5% smaller in
    memory.
  - kRp.corp.freq: the class gained a new slot called "caseSens", documenting
    whether the frequency statistics were calculated case sensitive (see
    read.corp.*() below).
  - validity check for objects of class kRp.tagged is a bit more liberal when
    TT.res doesn't have all expected columns and suggests to call fixObject()
    (see below) instead of failing with an error
  - adjusted unit tests
added:
  - summary(): method for class kRp.TTR now also supports the logical "flat"
    argument
  - new "[" and "[[" methods can be used to directly address the data.frames
    in tagged or hyphenated objects. that is, you don't have to call
    taggedText() or hyphenText() first, it will be done internally
  - new "[" and "[[" methods have also been added for objects of classes
    kRp.TTR and kRp.readability for quick access to their summary() results (index
    by measure)
  - treetag(): a new check will throw an informative error message if
    TreeTagger didn't return something the function can use
  - lex.div() et al.: new option "type.index" to produce the indices
    described above in the "changed" section
  - hyphen(): new option "as" to set the return value class, still defaults
    to "kRp.hyph", but can also be "data.frame" or "numeric"
  - new shortcut methods hyphen_df() and hyphen_c() use different defaults
    for "as"
  - treetag()/tokenize(): new option "add.desc" (see changed section)
  - taggedText(): new option "add.desc" to (re-)write the "desc" column in
    the data.frame, useful if it was omitted during treetag()/tokenize() but you
    want to add it later without retagging everything
  - read.corp.LCC()/read.corp.celex(): added new option "caseSens" to toggle
    whether frequency statistics should be calculated case sensitive or
    insensitive
  - new method fixObject() can upgrade old tagged objects from previous
    koRpus releases, i.e. add missing columns and adjust data types where needed
removed:
  - hyphen(): all parts of the package that were specific for hyphenation
    were removed as they are now part of the new sylly package. this includes the
    class definitions (kRp.hyph.pat and kRp.hyphen) and methods (correct(),
    hyphen(), show() and summary()) for those classes, as long as they in turn
    are not specific to koRpus. the hyphenation definitions were also removed
    from the language support files, as they are now part of individual
    language packages for the sylly package (sylly.en, sylly.de, etc.) that this
    package now depends on. you should, however, notice no difference in using
    the package, everything should just work like it did before this split.
  - the standard generics for describe() and language() were removed because
    they are now defined in the sylly package

changes in version 0.10-2 (2017-04-04)
fixed:
  - leftover typo in lang.support-en.R referencing "utf8-tokenize.pl" instead
    of "utf8-tokenize.perl" in the windows preset and a call to grep that is
    not present in Treetagger's *.bat file
  - readability(): fixed a minor issue with the internal handling of wrongly
    tagged dashes in the FOG formula (shouldn't have any effect on results)
changed:
  - if no encoding is provided and treetag() needs to write temporary files,
    output file encoding is now forced into UTF-8
  - hyphen(): caching now uses an environment instead of a data.frame. this
    means that old cache files will need to be changed as well. hyphen() will
    try to convert them on the fly, but if this fails you should remove the old
    files
  - hyphen(): cached results are now looked up much more efficient, speeding
    up the process drastically (about 100 times faster in my benchmarks!)
  - hyphen(): hyphenation patterns are now internally converted to
    environments which speeds up uncached runs (or first runs with cache) noticeably
  - readability(): default parameters are now always fetched by the internal
    function default.params(), individually for each index
  - source code: moved all wrapper functions for readability() and lex.div()
    from individual source files to one wrapper file, respectively. the source
    tree became a bit overcrowded over the years
added:
  - new options redability(index="validation") and
    lex.div(measure="validation") show current the status of validation. this info was previously only
    available as comments in the source code and is now directly available.
removed:
  - WSFT(): deprecated wrapper, was replaced by nWS() in 2012

changes in version 0.10-1 (2017-03-01)
fixed:
  - windows users could run into an error of an undefined object
    (TT.call.file) when using treetag()
changed:
  - CRAN doesn't accept leading zeroes in version numbers any longer and
    asked me to change 0.07 into 0.7. i'd rather play this safe, so i'm jumping
    right to 0.10 to keep the versioning consistent fo all users. the reason for
    this policy change was not explained to me, could be anything from "we
    think it looks ugly" to "it breaks our build systems".
  - allowing treetag() to run even when a defined lexicon file is not found.
    this previously resulted in an error and now causes only a warning message.

changes in version 0.07-2 (2016-12-21)
fixed:
  - the show method for Flesch Brouwer was not working properly
  - if a cache file for hyphen is set but not existing, it will be created
    automatically
  - the manual page for the wrapper function ELF() attributed the index to
    Farr, when it was in fact Fang (as correctly said in ?readability);
    vigilantly spotted by Mario Martinez
  - calling lex.div() on untagged character vectors didn't really work yet
  - guess.lang() had problems with newer UDHR files which included comments
    in the index.xml file
  - shiny app: was omitting the row names of tables in newer versions of shiny
  - treetag() appended the abbreviation list two times in english preset
  - TT.options checks in treetag() do no longer ask for mandatory options if
    TT.cmd is not "manual"
changed:
  - updated shiny app: disabling FOG by default (faster), adding Brouwer and
    MTLDMA.steps options, adding dutch and portuguese by default, disabled
    language selection in language guessing tab
  - shiny app: using fluidPage() now
  - shiny app: set tables to use bootstrap striped layout
  - reaktanz.de supports HTTPS now, updated references
added:
  - new summary() method for kRp.hyph objects
  - new show() methods for kRp.hyph and kRp.taggedText objects
  - new methods tokens() and types() to quickly get tokens and types of a text

changes in version 0.07-1 (2016-07-11)
fixed:
  - the treetag() function actually omittet options for the tokenizer due to
    a never updated variable and a wrong setting later on; this has been the
    case for years -- interesting that no-one ever noticed this
  - read.corp.LCC() can now digest newer LCC archives, omitting the
    *-meta.txt file if none is present, and also supporting *-words.txt files with
    duplicate columns
  - some typos in the ChangeLog...
  - fixed manual page for class kRp.corp.freq
changed:
  - the support for non-UTF-8 presets for was removed, since TreeTagger is
    only endorsing UTF-8 encoding itself for a while; the old preset names will
    continue to work for the time being, but if possible you should already
    rename them from "<lang>-utf8" into just "<lang>" in your scripts
  - removed options corp.rm.class and corp.rm.tag from method hyphen() for
    character strings
  - massively improved the speed of hyphen by using a new method for
    exploding words into their sub-parts. in benchmark tests (text with ~30.000 words)
    the new method only takes about 15% of the time without cache, and about
    50% with cache
  - massively improved the speed of lex.div() by reducing unnecessary
    computations. in benchmark tests (see above) the new method is more than 100
    times faster, which also makes readability() three times as fast with standard
    indices. if you disable the FOG index, readability() is now finished in
    an instant, too. see the new index="fast" option below
  - tokenize() now uses data.table() instead of data.frame() internally,
    leading to an increase in speed of about 20%
  - new slots "bigrams" and "cooccur" in S4 class kRp.corp.freq
  - cleaned up code
  - removed the never used variable TT.tknz.opts.def in the language support
  - set.lang.support() now checks for duplicate tag definitions and throws an
    error if any were found
  - renamed class and method files to set some environment first
  - moved several internal hyphenation functions to koRpus-internal.hyphen.R
  - moved several internal readability functions to
    koRpus-internal.rdb.formulae.R
added:
  - read.corp.LCC() can now import the information on bigrams and
    co-occurences of tokens in a sentence
  - language support now also uses TT.splitter, TT.splitter.opts, and
    TT.pre.tagger, which was needed mostly to implement the TreeTagger script for
    portuguese (available in the separate package koRpus.lang.pt), but also for
    updates of languages that were already supported
  - updated the RKWard plugin (UTF-8 defaults, added dutch and portuguese,
    added Brouwer formula)
  - new unit tests for lex.div(), tokenize() and readability()
  - new options to set index="fast" in readability() to drop FPG from the
    defaults for faster calculations
  - new option MTLDMA.steps to increase the step size for MTLD-MA. this
    diverts from the original proposal, but if your text is long enough, you will
    get a very good estimate and only need a fraction of the computing time

changes in version 0.06-5 (2016-06-05)
fixed:
  - fixed the Douma formula: based on available literature, the factor for
    average sentence length was set to 0.33, but the original paper reported it
    as 0.93
  - fixed the documentation for tokenize(), roxygen2 had problems with an
    escaped double quote
  - corrected some problems with umlauts in the docs
added:
  - new template for a roxyPackage script to make it easy to build packages
    from language support scripts
  - additional validation for ARI, flesch (en), flesch-kincaid, SMOG and FOG,
    via http://wordscount.info/wc/jsp/clear/analyze_readability.jsp
  - new Flesch parameters to calculate readability according to Brouwer (NL),
    can be invoked as index "Flesch.nl-b", "Flesch.Brouwer", or Flesch
    paremeters set to "nl-b"
  - now the manual is actually documenting all the various Flesch formulas,
    i.e., listing all parameter values, so that it's easier for users to check
    what is being calculated

changes in version 0.06-4 (2016-03-07)
fixed:
  - workaround for missing POS tag "NS" for english texts
  - made guess.lang() compatible with recent format of UDHR archives, now
    using ISO 639-3 codes as language identifier
  - tokenize() and treetag() weren't able to cope with text that only
    consisted of a single token
  - declared import from graphics package to satisfy CRAN checks
changed:
  - updated rkwarddev script according to recent development in the rkwarddev
    package
  - some basic validity checks of treetag()s "TT.options" moved to an
    internal function checkTTOptions(), which is now also called by set.kRp.env()
  - guess.lang() doesn't warn about missing EOL in the UDHR texts any longer
added:
  - added a README.md file
  - new option "no.unknown" can be passed to the "TT.options" of treetag(),
    to toggle the "-no-unknown" switch of TreeTagger
  - new option "validate" for set.kRp.env() to enable/disable checks

changes in version 0.06-3 (2015-11-02)
fixed:
  - actually query for supported POS tags in internal function
    is.supported.lang(). the function previously looked for supported languages in the
    available presets, which failed if there was no preset named like the language
    abberviation
  - made hyphen() not split words after first or before last character,
    therefore min.length was increased to 4 accordingly
  - adjusted test standards to changed hyphen results
added:
  - read.tagged() does now also accept matrix objects, see
    https://github.com/unDocUMeantIt/koRpus/issues/1

changes in version 0.06-2 (2015-09-21)
fixed:
  - read.corp.custom() calculated the in-document frequency wrong if analysis
    was performed case insensitive
  - updated some more links in the docs (?kRp.POS.tags)
changed:
  - correct.tag() now accepts all objects of class union kRp.taggedText
  - query() now uses "%in%" instead of "==" to match character strings
    against "query"
  - exported the previously internal function set.lang.support(), to prepare
    for the possibility of third party package to add new languages
added:
  - initial support to manually extend the languages supported by the
    package. you can now add new languages on-the-fly in a running session, or in a
    more sustainable manner by providing a language package (using the same
    methods, basically). key to this is the now globally available function
    set.lang.support(), and there's also two commented template scripts installed
    with the package, see the "templates" folder

changes in version 0.06-1 (2015-07-08)
fixed:
  - read.corp.custom() was buggy when dealing with tagged objects
  - suppress message stating text language in summary() for readability
    objects if "flat=TRUE"
changed:
  - changed the following functions into S4 methods: readability(),
    lex.div(), hyphen(), read.corp.custom() and freq.analysis()
  - removed long since deprecated function kRp.freq.analysis()
  - splitted the code of the monolithic internal function for
    read.corp.custom() into several subfunctions to get more flexibility
  - read.corp.custom() now also supports analysis of lists of tagged objects
  - removed option "fileEncoding" from the signature of read.corp.custom(),
    but it can still be used as part of the "..." options; this was neccessary
    because treetag() uses "encoding" instead
added:
  - new option "tagger" now also available in read.corp.custom()
  - there is now a mailing list to discuss the koRpus development:
    https://ml06.ispgateway.de/mailman/listinfo/korpus-dev_r.reaktanz.de

changes in version 0.05-6 (2015-06-30)
fixed:
  - changed "selected" values of checkboxGroupInput() in the shiny file ui.R
    to comply with the changes made in shiny 0.9.0
  - function kRp.text.transform() was missing some columns in TT.res
  - fixing this ChangeLog: the parameter for Szigriszt (Flesch ES) is not
    "es2", as reported in the log to koRpus 0.05.3, but "es-s"!
  - calling readability for "ARI.NRI" without hyphenation didn't work,
    allthough ARI doesn't need syllables
  - updated some broken links in the docs (?kRp.POS.tags, ?guess.lang)
  - added imports for 'utils' and 'stats' packages to comply with new CRAN
    checks
  - added a otherwise useless definition of "text" to the body of
    guess.lang(), also to satisfy R CMD check
changed:
  - replaced the RKWard plugin with a modularized rewrite (rkwarddev script)
  - some code cleaning in internal function kRp.rdb.formulae() and
    freq.analysis(), mostly replacing @ by slot()
added:
  - new readability formula tuldava(), kindly suggested by peter grzybek
  - the shiny app has gained support for Tuldava and Szigriszt (Flesch ES)
    formulae and log.base parameter (lexical diversity)
  - set.kRp.env() does now check whether a language preset is valid

changes in version 0.05-5 (2014-03-19)
changed:
  - removed Snowball from the list of suggested packages, as it is deprecated
    and fully replaced by SnowballC
  - re-generated all docs with roxygen2 3.1.0, which can now handle S4 class
    definitions properly
  - replaced all tabs in the source code by two space characters
added:
  - new tf-idf feature: read.corp.custom() now calculates idf, then
    freq.analysis() can use that to calculate tf-idf, kindly suggested by sandro tsang
  - new columns "inDocs" and "idf" in slot "words" of class kRp.corp.freq
  - new columns "tf", "idf" and "tfidf" in slot "words" of class kRp.txt.freq

changes in version 0.05-4 (2014-01-22)
fixed:
  - PCRE 8.34 caused the tests to fail because of problems with regular
    expressions in internal tokenizing function tokenz(); fixed by ensuring that
    "-" is being escaped as "\\-"

changes in version 0.05-3 (2013-12-21)
fixed:
  - due to a logical bug in calls to internal functions, the "lemmatize"
    argument if lex.div() didn't really have any effect
  - using file names with readability() and its wrappers was broken, works
    again now
changed:
  - the "tt" slot in class kRp.TTR gained two new entries, "lemmas" and
    "num.lemmas", kindly suggested by roberto trunfio
  - show() method for kRp.TTR objects now also lists the number of lemmas (if
    found)
  - parameters of Flesch formulae were slightly changed to be more accurate
    (from rounded values of 206.84 to 206.835) where applicable
  - Flesch-Szigriszt and Fernandez-Huerta have been validated against INFLESZ
    v1.0, so the warning was removed
  - readability.num() now gracefully accepts a single number of syllables for
    formulae who don't need to know more
  - added a proper GPL notice at the beginning of each R file
  - adjustet tests according to the changes made
added:
  - alternative Flesch parameters for spanish texts according to Szigriszt
    were added as parameters="es2", kindly suggested by carlos ortega
removed:
  - this is the first version of the package with slightly reduced sources on
    CRAN -- the debian directory, GPL license file and hyphenation pattern
    ChangeLog had to be removed. if you want the full sources to this package,
    please use the packages provided at http://reaktanz.de/?c=hacking&s=koRpus

changes in version 0.05-2 (2013-10-27)
fixed:
  - added two previously undocumented (and hence missing) italian tags "FW"
    and "LS"
  - removed some ::: operators which were not neccessary
  - updated slot "param" of kRp.TTR objects to include "min.tokens",
    "rand.sample", "window" and "log.base"
changed:
  - moved some parts of treetag() and kRp.text.paste() to internal functions
    for easier re-use of its functionality
added:
  - support for marco baroni's TreeTagger tagset for italian was added
  - added SnowballC to the suggested packages, as tokenize() and treetag()
    can also use SnowballC::wordStem() for stemming
  - new function read.tagged() can be used to import already tagged texts
  - new argument "apply.sentc.end" in function treetag()
  - new argument "log.base" in functions lex.div() and lex.div.num()

changes in version 0.05-1 (2013-05-05)
fixed:
  - DRP() readability formula tried to fetch a non-existing variable and
    hence didn't calculate; this also fixed a problem with summary(), if DRP
    results were expected in the object; tests had to be corrected as well
  - textFeatures() gets number of letters and TTR again
  - MTLD calculation (lex.div()) now counts a factor as full if it is <
    factor.size, it was implemented as <= factor.size before (thanks to scott
    jarvis for insight on the details)
  - summary() for kRp.TTR objects always showed MTLD, even if it was empty
changed:
  - vignette now describes the use of taggedText() and describe(), instead of
    direct access to slots
  - readability() now assumes that if there's any text, it represents at
    least one sentence, even if no sentence ending punctuation can be found
  - "quiet=TRUE" in readability(), readability.num(), lex.div() and
    lex.div.num() will now also suppress all warnings regarding validation status
  - MTLD calculation (lex.div()) was optimized and takes less than half of
    the time it used to. it also gained a new boolean argument "detailed", which
    is FALSE by default. this means that the full factor results are skipped
    now, which boosts performance even more (six times as fast as before)
  - the caching mechanism for hyphen() was restructured into internal
    functions, allowing for better access to the cached data
  - set.kRp.env() and get.kRp.env() have new signatures, namely, all
    previously hardcoded parameters have been replaced by the more flexible "...".
    usage stays the same, so there's no need to change any scripts, as long as
    you called all parameters by name, not only by position!
  - object class kRp.corp.freq can now have additional columns in slots
    "words" and "desc". this flexibility allows for using this class with valence
    data as well
  - query() now examines the desired columns to decide whether character or
    numeric operations are to be done
  - performance of hyphen() has been massively improved if cache=TRUE
  - guess.lang() now also standardizes the difference values; this was added
    to the respective summary() method, which also produces nicer output
  - the source code was re-organized a bit, to ensure classes and methods are
    found in an appropriate order; the collate roclet of roxygen2 had
    problems with this when running in R 3.0.0
added:
  - new function read.BAWL() to import BAWL-R data
  - new demo application for use with the "shiny" package, can be found in
    $SRC/inst/shiny
  - lex.div() now supports a new method for calculating MTLD (MTLDMA,
    moving-average)
  - new getter method hyphenText() to access the "hyphen" slot in kRp.hyphen
    objects
  - getter methods language() and describe() for kRp.hyphen objects also added
  - added "quiet" argument to lex.div.num()
  - guess.lang() can now analyze a given text directly, not only from files
  - set.kRp.env() can now explicitly unset parameters in the environment
  - set.kRp.env() and get.kRp.env() know a new parameter,
    "hyphen.cache.file", which can be set to a file name to read from/write to the hyphenation
    cache. this way you can easily restore cached hyphenation rules over
    sessions. if this parameter is set, it will be used by hyphen() automatically if
    called with "cache=TRUE"

changes in version 0.04-40 (2013-04-07)
fixed:
  - removed some non-ASCII characters, mostly from comments, to keep the
    package on CRAN; some author names are now spelled wrong, though...

changes in version 0.04-39 (2013-03-12)
fixed:
  - optimized tokenize() to also detect prefixes/suffixes of the defined
    heuristics if they co-occur with punctuation
  - re-saved hyph.fr.rda with explicitly UTF-8 ecoded vectors
  - renamed LICENSE to LINCENSE.txt, so it won't get installed, as demnanded
    by Writing R Extensions
changed:
  - the language specific heuristics "en" and "fr" in tokenize() were renamed
    into "suf" and "pre". but they are still available, with "fr" now
    activating both "suf" and "pre".
  - read.hyph.pat() now explicitly sets vector encoding to UTF-8 with
    Encoding()<-, to ensure that the generated objects don't cause warnings from R
    CMD check if they're included in packages
  - internally replaced paste(..., sep="") with paste0(...)
added:
  - added new getter/setter methods taggedText(), taggedText()<-, describe(),
    describe()<-, language() and language()<- for tagged text objects
  - added is.taggedText() test function
  - added a warning to treetag() if "TT.options" is not a list (because this
    will likely render the options meaningless if they *contain* a list).
  - tokenize() can now apply a list of patterns/replacements to given texts
    via the new "clean.raw" attribute, and even supports perl-like regular
    expressions. the replacements are done before the texts are tokenized, so this
    can be tried to globally clean up bad characters or simply replace
    strings, etc.
  - tokenize() and treetag() have a new option "stopwords" to enable stopword
    detection
  - kRp.filter.wclass() can now remove detected stopwords
  - tokenize() and treetag() have a new option "stemmer" to interface with
    stemmer functions/methods like Snowball::SnowballStemmer()

changes in version 0.04-38 (2012-11-30)
added:
  - added support for french (thanks to alexandre brulet)

changes in version 0.04-37 (2012-09-15)
fixed:
  - a typo in Spache calculation (substraction instead of addition of a
    constant) lead to wrong results
  - Spache now counts unfamiliar words only once, as explained in the
    original article
  - old Spache formula was missing in readability(index="all")
changed:
  - validated Linsear Write, Dale-Chall (1948) and Spache (1953) results and
    removed warnings
  - status messages of hyphen() and lex.div() have been replaced by a space
    saving prograss bar added
  - added tests for lex.div(), hyphen() and readability()

fixed:
  - tests should now work on any machine

changes in version 0.04-35 (2012-08-21)
changed:

    systems. the script is part of the windows installer of TreeTagger 3.2 (at
    least since june 2012)
fixed:
  - correct.*() methods now also update the descriptive statistics in
    corrected objects

changes in version 0.04-34 (2012-06-02)
added:
  - there's now a class union "kRp.taggedText" with the members "kRp.tagged",
    "kRp.analysis", "kRp.txt.freq" and "kRp.txt.trans"
changed:
  - advanced summary() statistics for objects returned by clozeDelete()
  - clozeDelete(offset="all") now iterates through all cloze variants and
    prints the results, including the new summary() data
  - clozeDelete() now uses the new class union "kRp.taggedText" as signature
  - read.corp.custom() now uses table(), "quiet" is TRUE by default, the new
    option "caseSens" can be used to ignore character case, and "corpus" can
    now also be a tagged text object
fixed:
  - summary() for objects of class kRp.txt.freq was broken
  - as("kRp.tagged") for objects of class kRp.txt.freq was broken

changes in version 0.04-33 (2012-05-26)
changed:
  - elaborated documentation for method cTest()
added:
  - added new method clozeDelete()
  - added new list "cTest" in desc slot of the objects returned by cTest(),
    which lists all words that were changed (in clozeDelete() this list is
    called "cloze")

changes in version 0.04-32 (2012-05-11)
added:
  - added new function jumbledWords() and new method cTest()
fixed:
  - kRp.text.paste() now also removes superfluous spaces at the end of texts
    (i.e., before the last fullstop)

changes in version 0.04-31 (2012-04-22)
added:
  - koRpus now suggests the "testthat" package and uses it for automatic tests
  - treetag() and tokenize() now also accept input from open connections
fixed:
  - treetag() shouldn't fail on file names with spaces any more

changes in version 0.04-30 (2012-04-06)
  - added features:
  - kRp.corp.freq class objects now include the columns 'lttr', 'lemma',
    'tag' and 'wclass'
  - query() for corpus frequency objects now returns objects of the same
    class, to allow nested queries
  - the 'query' parameter of query() can now be a list of lists, to
    facilitate nested requests more easily
  - query() can now invoke grepl(), if 'var' is set to "regexp"; i.e., you
    can now filter words by regular expressions (inspired by suggestions after
    the koRpus talk at TeaP 2012)

changes in version 0.04-29 (2012-04-05)
  - fixed bug in summary() for tagged objects without punctuation
  - renamed kRp.freq.analysis() to freq.analysis() (with wrapper function for
    backwards compatibility)
  - readability.num() can now directly digest objects of class kRp.readability
  - data documentation hyph.XX is now a roxygen source file as well
  - cleaned up summary() and show() docs
  - adjustements to the roxygen2 docs (methods)

changes in version 0.04-28 (2012-03-10)
  - code cleanup: initialized some variables by setting them NULL, to avoid
    needless NOTEs from R CMD check (hyphen(), and internal functions
    frqcy.by.rel(), load.hyph.pattern(), tagged.txt.rm.classes() and
    text.freq.analysis())
  - re-formatted the ChangeLog so roxyPackage can translate it into a NEWS.Rd
    file

changes in version 0.04-27 (2012-03-07)
  - prep for CRAN release:
  - 0.04-26 was short-lived...
  - really fixed plot docs
  - removed usage section from hyph.XX data documentation
  - renamed text.features() to textFeatures()
  - encapsulated examples in set.kRp.env()/get.kRp.env() in \dontrun{}
  - re-encoded hyph.XX data objects to UTF-8

changes in version 0.04-26 (2012-03-07)
  - fixed plot docs
  - prep for inital CRAN release

changes in version 0.04-25 (2012-03-05)
  - re-compressed all hyphenation pattern data files, using xz compression
  - lifted the R dependency from 2.9 to 2.10
  - compressed LCC tarballs are now detected automatically
  - kRp.freq.analysis() now also lists the log10 value of word frequencies in
    the TT.res slot
  - in the desc slot of kRp.txt.freq class objects, the rather misleading
    list elements "freq" and "freq.wclass" were more adequately renamed to
    "freq.token" and "freq.types", respectively
  - unmatched words in frequency analyses now get value 0, not NA
  - fixed wrong signature for option "tagger" in kRp.text.analysis()
  - fixed kRp.cluster() which still called some old slots

changes in version 0.04-24 (2012-03-01)
  - fixed bug for attempts to calculate value distribution texts without any
    sentence endings
  - all readability wrapper functions now also accept a list of text features
    for calculation
  - class kRp.readability now inherits kRp.tagged
  - readability() now checks for presence of a hyphen slot and re-uses it, if
    no new hyphen object was provided; this in addition to the previous
    change enables one to re-analyze a text more efficiently, as already calculated
    results are also preserved
  - letter and character distribution in kRp.tagged desc slot now include
    columns with zero values if the respective values are missing (e.g., no words
    with five letters, but some with six, etc.)
  - added summary method for class kRp.tagged, summarizing main information
    from the desc slot
  - added plot method for class kRp.tagged
  - show method for kRp.readability now lists unfamiliar words for
    Harris-Jacobson
  - cleaned up code of lex.div.num() a bit

changes in version 0.04-23 (2012-02-24)
  - added precise RGL formula option to FORCAST
  - removed validation warnings from several indices, because results have
    been checked against those of other tools, and were comparable, so the
    implementations of these measures are assumed to be correct: - lex.div(): TTR,
    MSTTR, C, R, CTTR, U, Maas, HD-D, MTLD (thanks a lot to scott jarvis &
    phil mccarthy for calculating sample texts!) - readability(): ARI, ARI NRI,
    Bormuth, Coleman-Liau, Dale-Chall, Dale-Chall PSK, DRP,
    Farr-Jenkins-Paterson, Farr-Jenkins-Paterson PSK, Flesch, Flesch PSK, Flesch-Kincaid, FOG,
    FOG PSK, FORCAST, LIX, RIX, SMOG, Spache, Wheeler-Smith
  - moved all calculation from readability() to an internal function
    kRp.rdb.formulae(). to make it easier to write a similar function to lex.div.num()
    for the readability fomulas as well
  - added readability.num()
  - adjusted exsyl calculation for ELF to the approach used in other
    measures, which also results in a change of its default "syll" parameter from 1 to
    2; also corrected a typo in the docs, the index was proposed by Fang, not
    Farr
  - readability results now list letter distribution, not character
    distribution in desc slot
  - the desc slot from readability calculations was enhanced so that it can
    directly be used as the txt.features parameter for readability.num()
  - docs were polished

changes in version 0.04-22 (2012-02-08)
  - further fixes to the Wheeler-Smith implementation. according to the
    original paper, polysyllabic words need to be counted, and the example given
    shows that this means words with more than one syllable, not three or more,
    as Bamberger & Vanecek (1984) suggested
  - fixed HD-D, previous results are now labelled as ATTR in the HDD slot
  - adjusted HD-D.char calculation for small number of tokens (probabilities
    are now set to 1, not NaN)
  - added MATTR characteristics
  - show() for lex.div() objects now also reports SD for characteristics

changes in version 0.04-21 (2012-02-07)
  - MTLD now uses a slightly more efficient algorithm, inspired by the one
    used for MATTR
  - MSTTR now also reports SD of TTRs
  - differentiated the word class adposition into pre-, post- and
    circumposition in the language support for german and russian
  - added both Tränke-Bailer formulae to readability(), incl. wrapper
    traenkle.bailer() and show()/summary() methods
  - Coleman formulae now also count only prepositions as such
  - fixed Wheeler-Smith (thanks to eleni miltsakaki)

changes in version 0.04-20 (2012-02-06)
  - added Moving Average TTR (MATTR) to lex.div(), incl. wrapper  MATTR() and
    show()/summary() methods
  - added "rand.sample" and "window" to the parameters returned by lex.div()
  - further re-arranged the code of readability() and lex.div() to make it
    easier to maintain
  - summary(flat=TRUE) for readability objects is now a numeric vector

changes in version 0.04-19 (2012-02-02)
  - added five harris-jacobson readability formulae, incl. wrapper
    harris.jacobson() and show()/summary() methods
  - updated vignette
  - MTLD characteristics are now twice as fast
  - classes "kRp.txt.freq" and "kRp.txt.trans" now simply extend
    "kRp.tagged", and "kRp.analysis" extends "kRp.txt.freq"
  - removed internal function check.kRp.object() (globally replaced by
    inherits())
  - fixed letter count issue in readability()
  - fixed bugs in loading word lists in readability()
  - fixed crash if index="all" in readability()
  - reordered default kRp.readabilty slot order alphabetically, as well as
    show() and summary() for readability results
  - renamed results of the Neue Wiener Sachtextformeln from WSTF* to nWS* in
    readability object methods show() and summary() for consistency
  - renamed WSFT() to nWS() for the same reason
  - cleaned up roxygen comments for more roxygen2 compliance

changes in version 0.04-18 (2012-01-22)
  - added missing word exclusion to Gunning FOG measure
  - added sentence length, word length, distribution of characters and
    letters to "desc" slot of class kRp.tagged and readability() results, where
    missing
  - both syllable (hyphen()) and character distributions gained inversed
    cummulation for absolute numbers and percentages, so this one table now makes
    it easy to see how many words with more/equal/less characters/syllables
    there are in a text
  - changed internals of kRp.freq.analysis() and readability() to re-use
    descriptives of tagged text objects
  - NOTE: this also changed the names of some result elements in their "desc"
    slots for overall consistency ("avg.sent.len" is now "avg.sentc.length",
    "avg.word.len" became "avg.word.length", and instances of "num.words",
    "num.chars" etc. lost the "num." prefix). in case you accessed these
    directly, check if you need to adopt these changes. this is a first round of
    changes towards 0.05, see the notes to 0.04-17 below!

changes in version 0.04-17 (2012-01-17)
  - replaced the english hyphenation parameter set with a new one, which was
    made with PatGen2 especially for koRpus
  - tokenize() will now interpret single letters followed by a dot as an
    abbreviation (e.g., of a name), not a sentence ending, if heuristics include
    "abbr"
  - fixed bug which caused hyphen() to drop syllables if only one pattern
    match was found
  - added cache support to the correct method of class kRp.hyphen
  - added number of words and sentences to "desc" slot of class kRp.tagged
  - elaborated treetag() error message if no TreeTagger command was specified
  - NOTE: koRpus 0.05 will likely merge some object classes similar to
    kRp.tagged, i.e. kRp.txt.freq and kRp.txt.trans, into one class for tokenized
    text, either replacing or inheriting those classes

changes in version 0.04-16 (2012-01-15)
  - added slot "desc" to class kRp.tagged, to have descriptive statistics
    directly available in the object
  - added support for descriptive statistics to tokenize() and treetag()
  - added function text.features() to extract a 9-features set from texts for
    authorship detection (inspired by a talk at the 28C3)
  - hyphen() can now cache results on a per session basis, making it
    noticeably faster

changes in version 0.04-15 (2012-01-04)
  - manage.hyph.pat() is now an exported function
  - added initial support for italian (thanks to alberto mirisola)
  - added italian hyphenation patterns
  - changed min.length from 4 to 3 in hyphen() and manage.hyph.pat()
  - hyphen now considers hyphenating before last letters of a word
  - tuned hyph.en (with contributions by laura hauser)
  - fixed check for existing tokenizer, tagger and parameter file in treetag()
  - fixed MTLD calculation for texts which don't make even one factor

changes in version 0.04-14 (2011-12-22)
  - added new internal function manage.hyph.pat() to add/replace/remove
    pattern entries for hyphenation
  - added number of tokens per factor and standard deviation to MTLD results
    (thx to aris xanthos for the suggestion)

changes in version 0.04-13 (2011-11-22)
  - added column "token" to slots MTLD$all.forw and MTLD$all.back of
    lex.div() results, so you can verify the results more easily
  - slot HDD$type.probs of lex.div() results is now sorted (decreasing)
  - removed warnings of missing encoding, since enc2utf() seems to do a
    pretty good job

changes in version 0.04-12 (2011-11-21)
  - added support for the newer LCC .tar archive format
  - changed vignette accordingly
  - for consistency, changed "words" and "dist.words" into "tokens" and
    "types" in class kRp.corp.freq, slot desc
  - added lgeV0 and the relative vocabulary growth measures suggested by Maas
    to lex.div(); furthermore, a is now reported instead of a^2
  - added lgV0 and lgeV0 to lex.div.num()
  - show method for class kRp.TTR now excludes Inf values from
    charasteristics values

changes in version 0.04-11 (2011-11-20)
  - added function lex.div.num(), calculates TTR family measures by numbers
    of tokens and types directly
  - cleaned up lex.div() code a little

changes in version 0.04-10 (2011-11-19)
  - fixed missing 'input.enc' information if treetag() option 'treetagger' is
    not "manual" but a script
  - enhanced encoding handling internally if none was specified
  - changed default value of 'case.sens' to FALSE in lex.div(), as this seems
    to be more common
  - changed default value of 'fileEncoding' from "UTF-8" to NULL and use
    enc2utf() internally if no encoding was defined

changes in version 0.04-9 (2011-10-27)
  - tokenize() now converts all input to UTF-8 internally, to prevent
    conflicts later on (treetag() does that since 0.04-7 already)
  - added an experimental feature to treetag() to replace TreeTagger's
    tokenizer with tokenize()

changes in version 0.04-8 (2011-09-21)
  - fixed bugs in treetag(): "debug" now works without "manual" config as
    well, and global TT.options are now found if no preset was selected

changes in version 0.04-7 (2011-09-16)
  - added "encoding" option to treetag() and defaults to the language presets
  - fixed some option check and file path issues in treetag()

  - fixed bug in getting the right preset: mixed "lang" and "preset" during
    the modularization

changes in version 0.04-3 (2011-08-19)
  - modularized language support by the internal function set.lang.support(),
    this should make it much easier to add new languages in the future,
    because it means to add only one R file. hyphen(), kRp.POS.tags() and treetag()
    now use this new method
  - added CITATION file

changes in version 0.04-2 (2011-08-18)
  - fixed duplicate "PREP" definition in spanish POS tags, which caused
    treetag() to consume lots of RAM
  - fixed superfluous "es" definitions in treetag()

changes in version 0.04-1 (2011-08-16)
  - added support for spanish (thanks to earl brown)
  - docs can be created from source by roxygen2 (but all class docs are
    static, until '@slot' works again)

changes in version 0.03-4 (2011-08-09)
  - added support for autodetection of headlines and paragraphs in tokenize()
  - added support to revert autodetected headlines and paragraphs in
    kRp.text.paste()
  - updated RKWard plugin to use tokenize()

changes in version 0.03-3 (2011-08-08)
  - added parameters for formula C and simplified formula to SMOG
  - enhanced readability formulas (like adding age levels to Flesch.Kincaid,
    grade levels to LIX)
  - removed the duplicate Amstad index (is now just Flesch.de)

changes in version 0.03-2 (2011-08-03)
  - added the full RKWard plugin as inst/rkward, so both get updated
    simultanously
  - added experimental internal functions to import result logs from
    Readability Studio and TextQuest

changes in version 0.03-1 (2011-07-29)
  - integrated internal tags to kRp.POS.tags(), so tokenize() can return
    valid kRp.tagged class objects, i.e. substitute TreeTagger if it's not
    available
  - consequently renamed 'treetagger' option into 'tagger' in readability(),
    kRp.freq.analysis() and kRp.text.analysis()
  - lots of small fixes

changes in version 0.02-9 (2011-07-17)
  - added a simple tokenize() function
  - first working version of read.corp.custom()
  - added "..." option to readability, kRp.freq.analysis and
    kRp.text.analysis, to configure treetag()
  - added TT.options to the get/set environment functions
  - changed default values for treetag() (for readability)
  - fixed bug in internal check.file() function (mode="exec" returned TRUE
    too soon)
  - added warning messages to readability() and lex.div() to make people
    aware these implemetations are not yet fully validatied
  - introduced release dates in this ChangeLog ;-) (reconstructed them for
    earlier releases from the time stamps on the server)
