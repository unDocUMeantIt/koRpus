\title{Transform text into cloze test format}
\usage{
clozeDelete(obj, ...)

\S4method{clozeDelete}{kRp.taggedText}(obj, every = 5, offset = 0, replace.by = "_",
      fixed = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An object of class "kRp.taggedText"}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to the method (as described in this document).}

\item{every}{Integer numeric,
      setting the frequency of words to be manipulated. By default,
every fifth word is being transformed.}

\item{offset}{Either an integer numeric,
      sets the number of words to offset the transformations. Or the
special keyword \code{"all"},
      which will cause the method to iterate through all possible offset values
and not return an object, but print the results (including the list with changed words).}

\item{replace.by}{Character, will be used as the replacement for the removed words.}

\item{fixed}{Integer numberic,
      defines the length of the replacement (\code{replace.by} will
be repeated this much times). If set to 0,
      the replacement wil be as long as the replaced word.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link[koRpus:kRp.tagged-class]{kRp.tagged}} with the added feature \code{diff}.
}
\description{
If you feed a tagged text object to this function, its text will be transformed into
a format used for cloze deletion tests. That is,
      by default every fifth word (or as specified by
\code{every}) will be replaced by a line. You can also set an offset value to specify where
to begin.
}
\details{
The option \code{offset="all"} will not return one single object,
      but print the results after iterating
through all possible offset values.
