Description: GNU R package: A set of tools to analyze texts. Includes, amongst others, functions for automatic language detection, hyphenation, several indices of lexical diversity (e.g., type token ratio, HD-D/vocd-D, MTLD)
 and readability (e.g., Flesch, SMOG, LIX, Dale-Chall). Basic import functions for language corpora are also provided, to enable frequency analyses (supports Celex and Leipzig Corpora Collection file formats) and measures
 like tf-idf. Support for additional languages can be added on-the-fly or by plugin packages. Note: For full functionality a local installation of TreeTagger is recommended. 'koRpus' also includes a plugin for the R GUI and
 IDE RKWard, providing graphical dialogs for its basic features. The respective R package 'rkward' cannot be installed directly from a repository, as it is a part of RKWard. To make full use of this feature, please install
 RKWard from https://rkward.kde.org (plugins are detected automatically). Due to some restrictions on CRAN, the full package sources are only available from the project homepage. To ask for help, report bugs, suggest feature
 improvements, or discuss the global development of the package, please subscribe to the koRpus-dev mailing list: https://ml06.ispgateway.de/mailman/ listinfo/korpus-dev_r.reaktanz.de
