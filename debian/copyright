The R library koRpus was originally written and is maintained by m.eik michalke <meik.michalke@hhu.de>.

This Debian package was put together by m.eik michalke <meik.michalke@hhu.de>.

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'koRpus' to
'r-other-reaktanz-korpus' in harmony with the R packaging policy to indicate
that the package is external to the CRAN or BioC repositories.
