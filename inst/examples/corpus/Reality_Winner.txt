Reality Leigh Winner (born December 4, 1991) is an American former intelligence specialist. In 2017, she was charged with "removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet". The material in question originated with the National Security Agency (NSA).

On June 3, 2017, while employed by the military contractor Pluribus International Corporation, Winner was arrested on suspicion of leaking an intelligence report about Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections to the news website The Intercept. The report suggested that Russian hackers accessed voter registration rolls in the U.S. with an email phishing operation, though it was unclear whether any changes had been made.

Concerns were raised that The Intercept's handling of the material exposed her as the source and contributed to her arrest. Twice denied bail, Winner was held at the Lincoln County Jail in Lincolnton, Georgia. On August 23, 2018, Winner was sentenced to five years and three months in prison as part of a plea deal. As of October 2020, she is incarcerated at the Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Ft. Worth, Texas. Her projected release date is November 23, 2021.
