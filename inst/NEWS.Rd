\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.13-4 (2020-12-11)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{treetag()}: allow for lexicon files to be optional and not return an error
        if none is found (which was the case with the newly added file name
        checks)
      \item \code{treetag()}: use "-lex" argument for lexicon files if no lookup command is
        given
      \item \code{treetag()}: always add lookup command from manual options even if a preset
        is used
      \item \code{read.corp.custom()}: calculation failed if caseSens=FALSE
      \item \code{tokenize()}/treetag(): force UTF-8 encoding on read texts to prevent
        windows from misunderstanding characters
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{treetag()} et al.: drastically increased the speed of calculating
        descriptive statistics (can be 100x faster for very large texts)
      \item updated the language package templates
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.13-3 (2020-10-15)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{treetag()}: the \code{"utf8"} check for lexicon files led to path errors if the
        lexicon was NULL
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.13-2 (2020-09-23)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item unit tests: \code{jumbledWords()} randomly created false positives, fixed by
        setting a seed
    }

\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.13-1 (2020-09-21)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{docTermMatrix()}: numbers were calculated correctly, but possibly added to
        the wrong columns, leading to a completely wrong document term matrix
      \item \code{treetag()}: a dumb misorderig of calls suppressed the \code{"utf8"} check for
        abbreviation files introduced with 0.11-5
      \item \code{treetag()}: also added a \code{"utf8"} check for lexicon files and \code{".txt"} file
        extensions (which might be missing in newer versions of TreeTagger)
      \item \code{correct.tag()}: stopped method from adding tag descriptions to objects
        that didn't have them yet
      \item \code{kRp_readability()}/kRp_corp_freq(): properly initialize the slots
      \item \code{readability()} wrapper functions: fixed a bunch of \code{readability.num()} calls
        including an unused hyphen argument
      \item \code{readability()}: HTML documentation had a wrong formula for LIX (LaTeX was
        correct)
      \item \code{textTransform()}: now recounting letters when scheme is \code{"normalize"} as it
        might have altered word lengths; the calculations of some data in the desc
        slot (all.chars, lines, normalized.space) as now also done relative to
        the old values, because they can't be correctly recalculated from a mere
        vector of tokens
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{docTermMatrix()}: optimzed calculation speed drastically
      \item \code{read.corp.custom()}: re-wrote most of the code, now based on
        \code{docTermMatrix()} and thereby up to 50 times faster; also removed the now unused quiet
        argument, as well as methods using the directory path or lists of tagged
        texts, because using methods of the tm.plugin.koRpus package instead is much
        more efficient now
      \item \code{show()}: simplified the code for kRp.text class objects and unified the
        horizontal positioning of resulting values
      \item \code{show()}: generalized the handling of factor columns to be able to deal
        with unexpected columns
      \item \code{tokenize()}, \code{treetag()}: always generate a doc_id if none was given; also
        improved the examples
      \item \code{readability()}: added some ASCII versions of the formulae to the
        documentation
      \item \code{readability()}: the code of the internal workhorse \code{kRp.rdb.formulae()} was
        cleaned up, now using the new helper functions \code{validate_parameters()},
        \code{check_parameters()} and \code{rdb_parameters()}, saving ~350 lines of code
      \item updated unit test
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item kRp.text: new replacement class for kRp.tagged, kRp.txt.freq,
        kRp.txt.trans; the TT.res slot was renamed into \code{"tokens"}, additional columns in the
        data frame are now ok, new slots \code{"features"} and \code{"feat_list"} to host
        analysis results like readability or lexical diversity, and the \code{"desc"} slot now
        always contains elements named by doc_id
      \item \code{docTermMatrix()}: new method to calculate document term matrices from TIF
        compliant token data frames and koRpus objects
      \item \code{doc_id()}, \code{hasFeatures()}, \code{hasFeatures()}<-, \code{features()}, \code{features()}<-,
        \code{corpusReadability()}, \code{corpusReadability()}<-, \code{corpusHyphen()}, \code{corpusHyphen()}<-,
        \code{corpusLexDiv()}, \code{corpusLexDiv()}<-, \code{corpusFreq()}, \code{corpusFreq()}<-,
        \code{corpusCorpFreq()}, \code{corpusCorpFreq()}<-, \code{corpusStopwords()}, \code{corpusStopwords()}<-: new
        getter/setter methods for kRp.text objects
      \item dependencies: the Matrix package was added to imports for \code{docTermMatrix()}
      \item \code{validate_df()}: new internal method to check data frames for expected
        columns
      \item \code{readability()}: new argument \code{"keep.input"} to define whether hyphen objects
        should be preserved in the output or dropped
      \item \code{hyphen()}, \code{lex.div()}: new argument \code{"as.feature"} to store results in the
        new \code{"feat_list"} slot of the input object rather than returning it directly
      \item \code{fixObject()}: new methods to convert old objects of deprecated classes
        kRp.tagged, kRp.txt.freq, kRp.txt.trans, and kRp.analysis
      \item \code{split_by_doc_id()}: new method transforms a kRp.text object with multiple
        doc_ids into a list of single-document kRp.text objects
      \item [[/[[<-: gained new argument \code{"doc_id"} to limit the scope to particular
        documents
      \item \code{describe()}/describe()<-: now support filtering by doc_id
    }
  }
  \subsection{removed}{
    \itemize{
      \item kRp.tagged, kRp.txt.freq, kRp.txt.trans, kRp.analysis: these classes were
        special cases of kRp.text, and since all their information can now be
        part of kRp.text objects, they are no longer used; they are actually still
        present, but considered deprecated and should be converted using \code{fixObject()}
      \item \code{readability()}, \code{freq.analysis()}: removed the methods that could be called
        on files directly instead of objects of class kRp.text. this simplifies
        the code and it's probably not too much to ask users to call \code{tokenize()} or
        \code{treetag()} directly instead of doing this internally with less control
      \item \code{freq.analysis()}: removed the \code{"tfidf"} argument; as it turned out, its
        value was never effectively used, the tf-idf was always calculated, and it
        seemed like a reasonable default anyway
      \item \code{kRp.text.analysis()}: now deprecated, just use \code{lex.div()} and
        \code{freq.analysis()} to the same effect
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.12-1 (2019-05-13)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{query()}: method was broken for tagged objects
      \item \code{textTransform()}: method was broken
      \item class kRp.txt.trans: renamed column \code{"token.old"} into \code{"token.orig"}, which
        is what was actually used by \code{textTransform()}; also added a validity test
        for those column names to prevent confusion
      \item \code{readTagged()}: adjusted default encoding
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{query()}: new method for objects of class data.frame, which is now used if
        \code{query()} is being called on koRpus class objects
      \item \code{query()}: now also supports all numerical queries for tagged texts that
        were previously only available for frequency objects
      \item \code{filterByClass()}: a new method for tagged text objects, replacing the
        \code{kRp.filter.wclass()} function, which is now deprecated
      \item \code{pasteText()}: like \code{filterByClass()}, but replacing \code{kRp.text.paste()}
      \item \code{readTagged()}: like \code{filterByClass()}, but replacing \code{read.tagged()}
      \item \code{readTagged()}: new argument mtx_cols for new tagger=\code{"manual"} setting,
        allowing to import data POS tagged with third party tools
      \item \code{textTransform()}: new scheme \code{"normalize"} to replace tokens by given query
        rules with a defined value or the result of a provided function
      \item \code{diffText()}/diffText()<-: new getter/setter methods for the \code{"diff"} slot of
        transformed text objects
      \item \code{originalText()}: new method to revert text transformations and get the
        original text
      \item \code{kRp.POS.tags()}: now includes universal POS tags by default
      \item new unit tests for many methods, including \code{query()}, \code{textTransform()},
        \code{readTagged()}, \code{filterByClass()}, \code{pasteText()}, \code{diffText()}, \code{originalText()},
        \code{jumbleWords()}, and \code{clozeDelete()}
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{tokenize()}: now a S4 method for objects of class character and connections
      \item \code{treetag()}: now a S4 method for objects of class character and connections
      \item class kRp.txt.trans: \code{"diff"} slot now also lists the transformations done
        to the tokens in a new list element called \code{"transfmt"}, the changed tokens
        in a data frame called \code{"transfmt.equal"} and normalization details in a
        list called \code{"transfmt.normalize"}
      \item language support: if you try using a preset but the langauge package
        wasn't loaded or even installed, a more elaborate error message is returned
        with hopefully useful hints to what to try next
      \item \code{jumbleWords()}: now a S4 method, no longer a function; the resulting
        object is now also of class kRp.txt.trans if the input was a tagged text
        object, preserving the original tokens
      \item \code{clozeDelete()}: now returns an object of class kRp.txt.trans, dropping the
        additional data frame in \code{"desc"}; this ist much more consistent with other
        text transformations in the packahe
      \item \code{cTest()}: like \code{clozeDelete()} now returns an object of class kRp.txt.trans,
        dropping the additional data frame in \code{"desc"}
      \item moved class union definition kRp.taggedText to its own file and updated
        the import calls on a number of files accordingly
      \item \code{textTransform()}: moved the whole code segment that combines the
        transformed text into the returned object to a separate internal function so it can
        be re-used by other text transforming methods
      \item \code{cTest()}: changed method signature from kRp.tagged to class union
        kRp.taggedText
      \item \code{summary()}: changed method signature from kRp.tagged to class union
        kRp.taggedText
      \item \code{plot()}: changed method signature from kRp.tagged to class union
        kRp.taggedText
      \item \code{lex.div()}: removed the validation warning for MATTR, implementation has
        been validated by kevin cunningham and katarina haley
      \item restructured source code files
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.11-5 (2018-10-27)}{
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{set.kRp.env()}/treetag(): now throws an error if you try to combine a
        language preset with TreeTagger's batch files as the tagger to use; some users
        seem to be confused about what to configure, and this error message
        hopefully helps them to understand why \code{treetag()} must fail in these cases
      \item \code{treetag()}: newer versions of TreeTagger will no longer have \code{"utf8"} in
        their parameter and abbreviation files. since we never know what version of
        TreeTagger we're dealing with, \code{treetag()} will from now on look for files
        with \code{"utf8"} if specified in the language package, but not fail if none is
        found, but also try for a non-labelled file and replace the file name on the
        fly if one is found
      \item grapheme clusters: in UTF-8, certain characters in some languages are
        shown as a single character, but technically are several characters combined.
        \code{nchar()} counts all combined parts individially, which in most use cases
        for this package is not what one expects. it now uses nchar(type=\code{"width"})
        for a letter count that is much closer to user's expectations
    }
  }
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{set.lang.support()}: explicitly set the sorting method for factor levels
        to \code{"radix"} as the new default \code{"auto"} (R >= 3.5) produced unstable results
        with different setups; hence some of the test standards also had to be
        updated
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.11-4 (2018-07-29)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item templates: incomplete package name in license header
      \item \code{read.BAWL()}: updated download URL and added DOI
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item the startup check for available language packages was reduced to short
        hints to \code{available.koRpus.lang()} and \code{install.koRpus.lang()}
      \item the startup message can now be suppressed by adding
        "noStartupMessage=TRUE" to the koRpus options in .Rprofile
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.11-3 (2018-03-07)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{treetag()}/tokenize(): fixed an issue with sentence numbering which was
        triggered if all sentences were of equal length
      \item \code{query()}: method failed for columns which are now factors
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{treetag()}: koRpus no longer fails with an error if unknown tags are
        found. there will be a warning, but you can continue to work with the object
      \item depends on R >= 3.0.0 now
      \item improved \code{available.koRpus.lang()} to make it more obvious how to install
        language support packages, and which
      \item session settings done with \code{set.kRp.env()} or queried by \code{get.kRp.env()} are
        no longer stored in an internal environment but the global .Options; this
        also allows for setting defaults in an .Rprofile file using \code{options()}
      \item in the docs, improved the link format for classes, omitting the "-class"
        suffix
      \item \code{set.lang.support()}: the levels of tag, wclass, and desc are now
        automatically sorted; test standards had to be adjusted accordingly
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{set.lang.support()}: new argument \code{"merge"}; it is now possible to add or
        update single POS tag definitions
      \item new class object contructors \code{kRp_tagged()}, \code{kRp_TTR()}, \code{kRp_txt_freq()},
        \code{kRp_txt_trans()}, \code{kRp_analysis()}, \code{kRp_corp_freq()}, \code{kRp_lang()}, and
        \code{kRp_readability()} can be used instead of new(\code{"kRp.tagged"}, ...) etc.

  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.11-2 (2018-01-07)}{
  \subsection{attention}{
    \itemize{
      \item this is a testing release introducing major changes in the way language
        support is handled (see other changes in this log). tl;dr: you must install
        additional koRpus.lang.** packages to fully restore the previous
        functionality, i.e., all supported languages. see ?install.koRpus.lang
    }
  }
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{treetag()}: with TT.tknz=FALSE, the last letter of a text was truncated
        due to a missing newline at the end of the tempfile (thanks to adam
        spannbauer for both reporting and fixing it)
      \item \code{treetag()}: hopefully fixed a nasty encoding issue on windows, again
      \item \code{treetag()}: fixed an issue that could be triggered by hard to tokenize
        texts exceeding a default limit of \code{summary()} for factors
      \item \code{treetag()}/tokenize(): silenced warnings of \code{readLines()} for missing final
        EOL of input files
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item language support: while the sylly package is released on CRAN now, its
        separate language packages were not allowed to be published there as well. a
        special repository was therefore set up on gitub and added via the
        \code{"Additional_repositories"} field to the DESCRIPTION file. however, not having the
        sylly.XX packages on CRAN made it necessary to further modularize the
        package and complete remove all out-of-the-box language support (see removed
        section). all these support packages for language are now being resolved
        by installing from that repo instead of CRAN.
      \item package loading: when koRpus is being loaded, it now checks for available
        (i.e. already installed) language packages. if none are found, it asks
        you to install one. i'm sorry for the unconvenience
      \item vignette is now in RMarkdown/HTML format; the SWeave/PDF version was
        dropped
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{tif_as_tokens_df()}: new method to get TT.res in fully TIF compliant format
      \item new functions \code{available.koRpus.lang()} and \code{install.koRpus.lang()} for more
        convenient handling of language support packages.
    }
  }
  \subsection{removed}{
    \itemize{
      \item language support: koRpus previously supported some languages directly
        (de, en, es, fr, it, and ru). this support had to be removed and is now
        available as separate language packages via
        https://undocumeantit.github.io/repos/l10n
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.11-1 (2017-06-20)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item kRp.lang: fixed the \code{show()} and \code{summary()} methods to omit country
        information which was dropped from the UDHR data a while ago
      \item \code{treetag()}: windows users might run into problems because of differences
        between the file separators R uses internally when they are also used in
        \code{shell()} calls. this hasn't been an issue earlier, but is worked around now
        anyway. hope this doesn't cause new issues...
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item kRp.tagged: the TT.res data.frame of the object class has new columns
        \code{"doc_id"}, \code{"idx"} (index), and \code{"sntc"} (sentence), with \code{"doc_id"} now being the
        first column before \code{"token"} to comply with the Text Interchange Formats
        proposed by rOpenSci
      \item kRp.tagged: in TT.res, the columns \code{"tag"}, \code{"wclass"} and \code{"desc"} are no
        longer character vectors but factors. this doesn't actually change the class
        definition, as TT.res just has to be a data.frame, but it reduces the
        object size especially for larger texts, and makes it much simpler to do
        analysis with these objects
      \item \code{tokenize()}/treetag()/\code{read.tagged()}: these functions now add token index
        and sentence number to the resulting objects; document ID is added if
        provided
      \item kRp.lang: depending on the information available in the UDHR data, the
        \code{show()} and \code{summary()} methods' output is now dynamically adjusted; \code{summary()}
        now also lists the columns "iso639-3" and \code{"bcp47"} by default
      \item \code{treetag()}: debug output for \code{tokenize()} looks a little nicer
      \item \code{kRp.text.transform()}: the old function is now deprecated and was replaced
        by a proper S4 method called \code{textTransform()}. the old one will work for
        the moment, but you'll get a warning
      \item the tt slot in class kRp.TTR gained two new entries called \code{"type.in.txt"}
        and \code{"type.in.result"}, which will contain a list of all types with the
        index where it is to be found in the original text or the \code{lex.div()} results
        respectively, if type.index=TRUE; the indices might differ because the
        result might be stripped of certain word classes
      \item \code{treetag()}/tokenize(): internal workflow for adding word class and
        description of tags was modularized for more detailed control. you can now toggle
        whether you want the verbose description of each tag added directly to
        objects with the new argument \code{"add.desc"}. it is set in the environment by
        \code{set.kRp.env()} and defaults to FALSE, making the objects about 5\% smaller in
        memory.
      \item kRp.corp.freq: the class gained a new slot called \code{"caseSens"}, documenting
        whether the frequency statistics were calculated case sensitive (see
        read.corp.*() below).
      \item validity check for objects of class kRp.tagged is a bit more liberal when
        TT.res doesn't have all expected columns and suggests to call \code{fixObject()}
        (see below) instead of failing with an error
      \item adjusted unit tests
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{summary()}: method for class kRp.TTR now also supports the logical \code{"flat"}
        argument
      \item new "[" and "[[" methods can be used to directly address the data.frames
        in tagged or hyphenated objects. that is, you don't have to call
        \code{taggedText()} or \code{hyphenText()} first, it will be done internally
      \item new "[" and "[[" methods have also been added for objects of classes
        kRp.TTR and kRp.readability for quick access to their \code{summary()} results (index
        by measure)
      \item \code{treetag()}: a new check will throw an informative error message if
        TreeTagger didn't return something the function can use
      \item \code{lex.div()} et al.: new option \code{"type.index"} to produce the indices
        described above in the \code{"changed"} section
      \item \code{hyphen()}: new option \code{"as"} to set the return value class, still defaults
        to \code{"kRp.hyph"}, but can also be \code{"data.frame"} or \code{"numeric"}
      \item new shortcut methods \code{hyphen_df()} and \code{hyphen_c()} use different defaults
        for \code{"as"}
      \item \code{treetag()}/tokenize(): new option \code{"add.desc"} (see changed section)
      \item \code{taggedText()}: new option \code{"add.desc"} to (re-)write the \code{"desc"} column in
        the data.frame, useful if it was omitted during \code{treetag()}/tokenize() but you
        want to add it later without retagging everything
      \item \code{read.corp.LCC()}/read.\code{corp.celex()}: added new option \code{"caseSens"} to toggle
        whether frequency statistics should be calculated case sensitive or
        insensitive
      \item new method \code{fixObject()} can upgrade old tagged objects from previous
        koRpus releases, i.e. add missing columns and adjust data types where needed
    }
  }
  \subsection{removed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{hyphen()}: all parts of the package that were specific for hyphenation
        were removed as they are now part of the new sylly package. this includes the
        class definitions (kRp.hyph.pat and kRp.hyphen) and methods (\code{correct()},
        \code{hyphen()}, \code{show()} and \code{summary()}) for those classes, as long as they in turn
        are not specific to koRpus. the hyphenation definitions were also removed
        from the language support files, as they are now part of individual
        language packages for the sylly package (sylly.en, sylly.de, etc.) that this
        package now depends on. you should, however, notice no difference in using
        the package, everything should just work like it did before this split.
      \item the standard generics for \code{describe()} and \code{language()} were removed because
        they are now defined in the sylly package

\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.10-2 (2017-04-04)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item leftover typo in lang.support-en.R referencing "utf8-tokenize.pl" instead
        of "utf8-tokenize.perl" in the windows preset and a call to grep that is
        not present in Treetagger's *.bat file
      \item \code{readability()}: fixed a minor issue with the internal handling of wrongly
        tagged dashes in the FOG formula (shouldn't have any effect on results)
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item if no encoding is provided and \code{treetag()} needs to write temporary files,
        output file encoding is now forced into UTF-8
      \item \code{hyphen()}: caching now uses an environment instead of a data.frame. this
        means that old cache files will need to be changed as well. \code{hyphen()} will
        try to convert them on the fly, but if this fails you should remove the old
        files
      \item \code{hyphen()}: cached results are now looked up much more efficient, speeding
        up the process drastically (about 100 times faster in my benchmarks!)
      \item \code{hyphen()}: hyphenation patterns are now internally converted to
        environments which speeds up uncached runs (or first runs with cache) noticeably
      \item \code{readability()}: default parameters are now always fetched by the internal
        function \code{default.params()}, individually for each index
      \item source code: moved all wrapper functions for \code{readability()} and \code{lex.div()}
        from individual source files to one wrapper file, respectively. the source
        tree became a bit overcrowded over the years
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item new options redability(index=\code{"validation"}) and
        lex.div(measure=\code{"validation"}) show current the status of validation. this info was previously only
        available as comments in the source code and is now directly available.
    }
  }
  \subsection{removed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{WSFT()}: deprecated wrapper, was replaced by \code{nWS()} in 2012

    \itemize{
      \item windows users could run into an error of an undefined object
        (TT.call.file) when using \code{treetag()}
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item CRAN doesn't accept leading zeroes in version numbers any longer and
        asked me to change 0.07 into 0.7. i'd rather play this safe, so i'm jumping
        right to 0.10 to keep the versioning consistent fo all users. the reason for
        this policy change was not explained to me, could be anything from "we
        think it looks ugly" to "it breaks our build systems".
      \item allowing \code{treetag()} to run even when a defined lexicon file is not found.
        this previously resulted in an error and now causes only a warning message.

  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.07-2 (2016-12-21)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item the show method for Flesch Brouwer was not working properly
      \item if a cache file for hyphen is set but not existing, it will be created
        automatically
      \item the manual page for the wrapper function \code{ELF()} attributed the index to
        Farr, when it was in fact Fang (as correctly said in ?readability);
        vigilantly spotted by Mario Martinez
      \item calling \code{lex.div()} on untagged character vectors didn't really work yet
      \item \code{guess.lang()} had problems with newer UDHR files which included comments
        in the index.xml file
      \item shiny app: was omitting the row names of tables in newer versions of shiny
      \item \code{treetag()} appended the abbreviation list two times in english preset
      \item TT.options checks in \code{treetag()} do no longer ask for mandatory options if
        TT.cmd is not \code{"manual"}

        MTLDMA.steps options, adding dutch and portuguese by default, disabled
        language selection in language guessing tab
      \item shiny app: using \code{fluidPage()} now

  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.07-1 (2016-07-11)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item the \code{treetag()} function actually omittet options for the tokenizer due to
        a never updated variable and a wrong setting later on; this has been the
        case for years -- interesting that no-one ever noticed this
      \item \code{read.corp.LCC()} can now digest newer LCC archives, omitting the
        *-meta.txt file if none is present, and also supporting *-words.txt files with
        duplicate columns
      \item some typos in the ChangeLog...
      \item fixed manual page for class kRp.corp.freq
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item the support for non-UTF-8 presets for was removed, since TreeTagger is
        only endorsing UTF-8 encoding itself for a while; the old preset names will
        continue to work for the time being, but if possible you should already
        rename them from "<lang>-utf8" into just "<lang>" in your scripts
      \item removed options corp.rm.class and corp.rm.tag from method \code{hyphen()} for
        character strings
      \item massively improved the speed of hyphen by using a new method for
        exploding words into their sub-parts. in benchmark tests (text with ~30.000 words)
        the new method only takes about 15\% of the time without cache, and about
        50\% with cache
      \item massively improved the speed of \code{lex.div()} by reducing unnecessary
        computations. in benchmark tests (see above) the new method is more than 100
        times faster, which also makes \code{readability()} three times as fast with standard
        indices. if you disable the FOG index, \code{readability()} is now finished in
        an instant, too. see the new index=\code{"fast"} option below
      \item \code{tokenize()} now uses \code{data.table()} instead of \code{data.frame()} internally,
        leading to an increase in speed of about 20\%
      \item new slots \code{"bigrams"} and \code{"cooccur"} in S4 class kRp.corp.freq
      \item cleaned up code
      \item removed the never used variable TT.tknz.opts.def in the language support
      \item \code{set.lang.support()} now checks for duplicate tag definitions and throws an
        error if any were found
      \item renamed class and method files to set some environment first
      \item moved several internal hyphenation functions to koRpus-internal.hyphen.R
      \item moved several internal readability functions to
        koRpus-internal.rdb.formulae.R
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{read.corp.LCC()} can now import the information on bigrams and
        co-occurences of tokens in a sentence
      \item language support now also uses TT.splitter, TT.splitter.opts, and
        TT.pre.tagger, which was needed mostly to implement the TreeTagger script for
        portuguese (available in the separate package koRpus.lang.pt), but also for
        updates of languages that were already supported
      \item updated the RKWard plugin (UTF-8 defaults, added dutch and portuguese,
        added Brouwer formula)
      \item new unit tests for \code{lex.div()}, \code{tokenize()} and \code{readability()}
      \item new options to set index=\code{"fast"} in \code{readability()} to drop FPG from the
        defaults for faster calculations
      \item new option MTLDMA.steps to increase the step size for MTLD-MA. this
        diverts from the original proposal, but if your text is long enough, you will
        get a very good estimate and only need a fraction of the computing time

  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item fixed the Douma formula: based on available literature, the factor for
        average sentence length was set to 0.33, but the original paper reported it
        as 0.93
      \item fixed the documentation for \code{tokenize()}, roxygen2 had problems with an
        escaped double quote
      \item corrected some problems with umlauts in the docs

        via http://wordscount.info/wc/jsp/clear/analyze_readability.jsp
      \item new Flesch parameters to calculate readability according to Brouwer (NL),
        can be invoked as index "Flesch.nl-b", \code{"Flesch.Brouwer"}, or Flesch
        paremeters set to "nl-b"

        abberviation
      \item made \code{hyphen()} not split words after first or before last character,

      \item MTLD calculation (\code{lex.div()}) was optimized and takes less than half of
        the time it used to. it also gained a new boolean argument \code{"detailed"}, which
        is FALSE by default. this means that the full factor results are skipped
        now, which boosts performance even more (six times as fast as before)
      \item the caching mechanism for \code{hyphen()} was restructured into internal
        functions, allowing for better access to the cached data
      \item \code{set.kRp.env()} and \code{get.kRp.env()} have new signatures, namely, all
        previously hardcoded parameters have been replaced by the more flexible \code{"..."}.
        usage stays the same, so there's no need to change any scripts, as long as
        you called all parameters by name, not only by position!
      \item object class kRp.corp.freq can now have additional columns in slots
        \code{"words"} and \code{"desc"}. this flexibility allows for using this class with valence
        data as well
      \item \code{query()} now examines the desired columns to decide whether character or
        numeric operations are to be done
      \item performance of \code{hyphen()} has been massively improved if cache=TRUE
      \item \code{guess.lang()} now also standardizes the difference values; this was added
        to the respective \code{summary()} method, which also produces nicer output
      \item the source code was re-organized a bit, to ensure classes and methods are
        found in an appropriate order; the collate roclet of roxygen2 had
        problems with this when running in R 3.0.0

      \item \code{set.kRp.env()} can now explicitly unset parameters in the environment
      \item \code{set.kRp.env()} and \code{get.kRp.env()} know a new parameter,
        \code{"hyphen.cache.file"}, which can be set to a file name to read from/write to the hyphenation
        cache. this way you can easily restore cached hyphenation rules over
        sessions. if this parameter is set, it will be used by \code{hyphen()} automatically if
        called with "cache=TRUE"

      \code{"types"} in class kRp.corp.freq, slot desc
    \item added lgeV0 and the relative vocabulary growth measures suggested by Maas
      to \code{lex.div()}; furthermore, a is now reported instead of a^2

    \item show method for class kRp.TTR now excludes Inf values from
      charasteristics values

\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.04-11 (2011-11-20)}{
  \itemize{
    \item added function \code{lex.div.num()}, calculates TTR family measures by numbers
      of tokens and types directly

  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.04-10 (2011-11-19)}{
  \itemize{
    \item fixed missing 'input.enc' information if \code{treetag()} option 'treetagger' is
      not \code{"manual"} but a script
    \item enhanced encoding handling internally if none was specified
    \item changed default value of 'case.sens' to FALSE in \code{lex.div()}, as this seems
      to be more common
    \item changed default value of 'fileEncoding' from "UTF-8" to NULL and use
      \code{enc2utf()} internally if no encoding was defined
  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.04-9 (2011-10-27)}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{tokenize()} now converts all input to UTF-8 internally, to prevent

      tokenizer with \code{tokenize()}
  }
}

      well, and global TT.options are now found if no preset was selected

      the modularization
  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.04-3 (2011-08-19)}{
  \itemize{
    \item modularized language support by the internal function \code{set.lang.support()},
      this should make it much easier to add new languages in the future,
      because it means to add only one R file. \code{hyphen()}, \code{kRp.POS.tags()} and \code{treetag()}
      now use this new method
    \item added CITATION file
  }
}
\section{Changes in koRpus version 0.04-2 (2011-08-18)}{

      available

    \item fixed bug in internal \code{check.file()} function (mode=\code{"exec"} returned TRUE

    \item added warning messages to \code{readability()} and \code{lex.div()} to make people
      aware these implemetations are not yet fully validatied

      was no windows binary for the XML package, which was obviously a problem...)
